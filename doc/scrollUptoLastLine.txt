NAME                                                        *scrollUptoLastLine-name*

`scrollUptoLastLine.vim` - A Vim plugin to stop mouse scrolling at the last 
line, similar to setting `scrollBeyondLastLine` to `false` in VSCode.

SYNOPSIS                                                    *scrollUptoLastLine-synopsis*

This plugin modifies the behavior of mouse scrolling in Vim. When installed and 
enabled, it prevents the mouse from scrolling beyond the last line of the 
document.

DESCRIPTION                                                *scrollUptoLastLine-description*

`scrollUptoLastLine.vim` is designed for users who prefer the editor's viewport 
to stop at the last line of the file, avoiding extra empty space below the last 
line during scrolling. This feature is akin to the `scrollBeyondLastLine` 
setting in VSCode when set to `false`.

OPTIONS                                                    *scrollUptoLastLine-options*

`g:scroll_upto_lastline_padding`
    This global variable sets the number of lines to show after the last line of 
    the file when scrolling reaches the end. For instance, setting this variable 
    to 5 will allow the user to see five lines past the last line of the file 
    while scrolling. The default value is `&scrolloff`.

USAGE                                                      *scrollUptoLastLine-usage*

After installing, the plugin works automatically. You can adjust the padding by 
setting `g:scroll_upto_lastline_padding` in your `.vimrc` file, like so:

    let g:scroll_upto_lastline_padding = 3

QA                                                         *scrollUptoLastLine-qa*

Issue: Strange Behavior When Push <SHIFT> After Scrolling
    Q: When I hold Shift after scroll, the behavior seems erratic. What's happening?
    A: This issue is likely due to `<S-MouseUp>` being unintentionally active. 
       To resolve this, remap `<S-MouseUp>` to `<Nop>` (No operation). You can 
       do this by adding the following line to your `.vimrc`:

       noremap <S-MouseUp> <Nop>
       inoremap <S-MouseUp> <Nop>

       This remapping prevents any unintended actions when shift-scrolling.
